1) close all arduino instances
2) copy the DFPlayer-Mini-mp3 directory to your libraries folder
3) copy the mp3demo1 directory to your arduino projects folder
4) open the mp3demo1 project
5) build and upload
6) wire the circuit up per mp3.jpg (you'll need to solder on a couple leads to your speaker)
7) copy the mp3 folder to your SD card (keep them in the mp3 directory. I have an SD reader if you want to bring me your SD card)
8) put the SD card into the MP3 module

If you're this far, great!
